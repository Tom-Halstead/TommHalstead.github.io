          My name is Thomas Halstead, although I typically go by Tom or Tommy. I
          am 25 years old and currently residing in Austin, Texas. Although, I'm
          originally from Utah. I love the outdoors and anything to do with it;
          from skiiing, biking, hiking, and everything in-between!

          My whole life I've loved computers. Starting from as early as I can
          remember playing Motocross Madness released by Micrsosoft in 1998, or
          games such as, minesweeper, chess titans, and checkers. One thing's
          for sure, computers have always intrigued me greatly. Since then, my
          passion for computer science has been like a fuse that's been lit and
          refuses to go out.

          Fast forward to the present day, where I am working diligently
          everyday to achieve my goal of becoming a developer. From keeping up
          with the market and job scene, to staying up to date with latest
          technologies, concepts, and trends. Logical thinking and problem
          solving have always been a solid foundation of mine, as I love a
          challenge that makes me think and possibly want to scratch my eyes
          out. Little did I know, there was a perfect field out there for me, in
          which I can practice scratching my eyes out every single day, in
          programming.
