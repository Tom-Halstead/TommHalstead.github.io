          My name is Thomas Halstead although I typically go by Tom or Tommy. I
          am 25 years old and currently residing in Austin, Texas. I'm
          originally from Utah, but I had been traveling from state to state
          with my previous job building Amazons and UPS buildings. While I did
          enjoy that line of work for a while, I realized that it's not the job
          for me and that I want to do more and push myself to my full ability
          and/or capabilities. My whole life I've loved computers, logical
          thinking and problem solving. Little did I know, there was a perfect
          field out there for me which I found in programming. I've been
          studying and ingesting every bit of relative information that I
          possibly can in order to break into this wonderful field of computer
          science that I am so passionate and devoted to. I'm ecstatic to be
          able to get a web development job, in order to test and grow my
          knowledge in this field.
